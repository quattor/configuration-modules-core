=head1 NAME

NCM::Component::spma::ips - NCM SPMA configuration component for IPS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<Configure ()>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Invoked by B<NCM::Component::spma> via 'B<ncm-ncd -configure ncm-spma>' when
B</software/components/spma/packager> is B<ips>.  Processes requests for
IPS packages to be added to a new Solaris boot environment and generates a
command file that may be executed by B<spma-run>.

This module is intended for package management with Quattor on Solaris 11
or later.

=head1 RESOURCES

=over

=item B</software/catalogues> ? nlist {}

A list of catalogues (package groups) to install.  The format is:

{I<package_name>}/{I<version>}

For example:

    prefix '/software/catalogues';
    '{pkg://solaris/entire}/{0.5.11,5.11-0.175.1.10.0.5.0}' = '';

The intention is that a host's software inventory is predominantly defined
by a small number of software catalogues that pull in almost all of the
packages required for the build.

Catalogues must be versioned and a host is progressed from one version
of a build to another by shifting the catalogue version numbers.

=item B</software/requests> ? nlist ()

A list of additional packages to install.  The format is:

{I<package_name>}[/{I<version>}]

For example:

    '/software/requests/{ms/afs/client}' = nlist();
    '/software/requests/{idr537}/{2}' = '';

The version number is optional and should generally be omitted.  It is
intended that the version number of packages that can be requested individually
are defined by a catalogue (e.g. constrained by an incorporate dependency).

=item B</software/uninstall> ? nlist ()

A list of packages to uninstall.  Packages in this list will not be installed,
and will be passed to the B<pkg install> command via the B<--reject> option.
The format is the same as with B</software/requests>.

=item B</software/components/spma/packager> ? string

Must contain 'B<ips>' to use this module.

=item B</software/components/spma/run> ? string

Set to B<yes> to allow this module to launch B<spma-run --execute> to make
immediate changes to the new boot environment.  If set to B<no> or omitted,
this module prepares and validates the changes only, but does not perform
any updates, it will be the responsibility of an external process to launch
B<spma-run --execute> in this case.

=item B</software/components/spma/userpkgs> ? string

Set to B<yes> to allow user-installed packages.  If set to B<no> or omitted,
then SPMA will find all leaf packages that have not been requested and
uninstall them via B<--reject> arguments to B<pkg install>.

=item B</software/components/spma/pkgpaths> : string []

Contains a list of resource paths where catalogues and individual package
requests are located.  Should be set to:

    list("/software/catalogues", "/software/requests");

=item B</software/components/spma/uninstpaths> : string []

Contains a list of resource paths where packages to uninstall are located.
Should be set to:

    list("/software/uninstall");

=item B</software/components/spma/cmdfile> : string

Where to save commands for the B<spma-run> script.  Default location
is B</var/tmp/spma-commands>.

=item B</software/components/spma/flagfile> ? string

File to touch if B</software/components/spma/run> is set to B<no> and this
module has determined that there is work to do, i.e. packages to install or
to uninstall.  If the file exists after this module has completed, then
B<spma-run --execute> can be run to create a new BE and make package changes
in that BE.

=item B</software/components/spma/ips/bename> ? string

Name of boot environment that B<spma-run> will use when making any
changes to packages.  If a BE by that name already exists, then a
unique number will be appended to the name.  Package changes will
be effected via 'B<pkg install --be-name> I<bename>'.

If this resource is missing then 'B<pkg install --require-new-be>' will be used
instead, leaving Solaris to decide on the name of the new BE.

=item B</software/components/spma/ips/rejectidr> : boolean

Add a B<--reject> option to the B<pkg install> command for every Solaris IDR
installed that has not been explicitly requested.

Default is B<true>.

=item B</software/components/spma/ips/freeze> : boolean

Ignore frozen packages.  This will prevent SPMA from updating or uninstalling
frozen packages.

Default is B<true>.

=back

=head1 NOTES

This module does not support making changes in the currently active boot
environment.  The intention is that it is executed when a host is rebooted
via a call to 'B<ncm-ncd -configure spma>' and then 'B<spma-run --execute>'
called immediately afterwards.  The system will then reboot into the
newly created boot environment if any changes were made.

IPS publisher configuration is currently not supported by this module.

=head1 EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION

The following PAN code snippet demonstrates how to prepare SPMA for
Solaris:

    #
    # Configure SPMA appropriately for Solaris
    #
    prefix "/software/components/spma";
    "packager" = "ips";
    "pkgpaths" = list("/software/catalogues", "/software/requests");
    "uninstpaths" = list("/software/uninstall");
    "register_change" = list("/software/catalogues",
                             "/software/requests",
                             "/software/uninstall");
    "flagfile" = "/var/tmp/spma-run-flag"
