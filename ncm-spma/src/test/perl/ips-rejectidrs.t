=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tests the C<ips::reject_idrs> method.  This method adds Oracle IDRs
(packages with prefix 'idr' that contain official hotfixes) that appear
in a given list of installed packages to the hash of packages to reject.

=head1 TESTS

The test provides a dummy set of installed packages and verifies that
the IDRs are correctly added to the supplied hash.
