=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tests for the C<spare_dependencies> method.  This method actually
chooses one of two other methods, depending on the estimated size of
the query.

=head2 Nothing to be done

If either set is empty, nothing is done.

=cut

=head2 The correct callee is chosen

In most circumstances the C<requires> path is used.  Only in very
large installations with almost nothing to remove we resort to the
C<whatreq> path.

=cut

$install->insert(qw(a b c d));
is($cmp->spare_dependencies($rm, $install), "requires",
   "Correct method is called when install part is small");

$install->insert(0..2000);
is($cmp->spare_dependencies($rm, $install), "whatreq",
   "The whatrequires method is called only when the win is obvious");
