=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tests the C<ips::merge_pkg_paths> and C<ips::gethash_ips> methods.  These
methods merge package lists from multiple resource paths and convert them
from nlists into a hash of package names and version numbers.

=head1 TESTS

The test provides some representative resource paths to the methods and
verifies the output.
