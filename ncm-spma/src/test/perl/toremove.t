=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tests for the C<packages_to_remove> method.  This method returns the
exact set of packages to be removed, based on the lists of packages
installed and specified in the profile.

The symplistic approach of removing whatever is not listed in the
profile doesn't work for Yum: packages may have been installed due to
dependencies.

Instead, we'll have to remove only a few leaf packages, and
let C<clean_requirements_on_remove> do the rest of the work.
