=head1 NAME

cron -- NCM component to control entries in the /etc/cron.d directory

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The I<cron> component manages files in the /etc/cron.d directory.
Files managed by this component will have the ncm-cron.cron suffix.
Other files in the directory are not affected by this component.  The
name of each file will be taken from the nlist name.

This component can also be used to configure which users are permitted
to use the crontab command via the cron.allow and cron.deny files.

=head1 MAIN RESOURCES

=head2 /software/components/cron/entries

A list containing cron structures (described below).

=head2 /software/components/cron/allow

A list of user names to be written into the cron.allow file.

=head2 /software/components/cron/deny

A list of user names to be written into the cron.deny file.

=head2 /software/components/cron/securitypath

Location of the cron.allow and cron.deny files. Defaults to '/etc'.



=head1 ENTRY RESOURCES

Each cron entry in the /software/components/cron/entries list may
contain the properties and resources described below. One of "frequency"
or "timing" must be specified.

=over 4

=item B<command> : string (required)

Command line to execute, including all its options.

Default : None

=item B<comment> : string (optional)

An optional comment to add at the beginning of the cron file.

Default : None

=item B<env> : nlist (optional)

An optional nlist containing environment variable that must be
defined before executing the command. Key is
the variable name, value is variable value.

Default : None

=item B<frequency> : string (optional)

Execution frequency for the command, using standard cron syntax.
Minutes field can be 'AUTO' : in this case,
a random value between 0 and 59 inclusive is generated.
This can be used to avoid too many machines executing the same
cron at the same time. See also the "timing" element.

Default : None

=item B<group> : string (optional)

Group to use to run the command. Defaults to user's primary group.

Default : user's primary group

=item B<log> : nlist (optional)

A nlist allowing to define specific attributes for cron log file.
Supported attributes are :

=over 4

=item name

name of the log file. If the name is not an absolute file name, file is created in /var/log.
Default name is the cron file name with .log extension in /var/log.

=item owner

owner/group of the log file, using owner:group format. group can be ommitted.

=item mode

permissions of log file specified as a string interpreted as an octal number.

=item disabled

A boolean value disabling the redirection of script output/error to a log file

=back

=item B<name> : string (required)

Name of the cron entry file to create.

Default : None

=item B<timing> : nlist (optional)

If the 'timing' nlist is used to specify the time, it can
contain any of the keys: 'minute', 'hour', 'day', 'month' and 'weekday'. An
unspecified key will have a value of '*'. A further key of 'smear' can
be used to specify (in seconds) a maximum interval for smearing the start
time, which can be as much as a day. When a smeared job is created, a
random increment between zero and the smear time is applied to the start time of the
job.  If the start time results in the job running on the following day, then all other
fields (day, weekday, etc) will be suitably modified. When smearing is
specified, then the start minute (and possibly hour, if smear is more than one hour) must be
specified as a simple absolute (e.g. '2') and cannot be variations such as lists or ranges.
Time specifications such as ranges, lists and steps are supported except for
named values (e.g. "1" must be used instead of "mon").

=item B<user> : string (optional)

User to use to run the command.

Default : root

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE

  "/software/components/cron/entries" = list(
    nlist(
      "name","ls",
      "user","root",
      "group","root",
      "frequency", "*/2 * * * *",
      "command", "/bin/ls"),
    nlist(
      "name","hostname",
      "comment", "some interesting text",
      "frequency", "*/2 * * * *",
      "command", "/bin/hostname"),
      "env", nlist("MAILTO", "admin@example.org"),
    nlist(
      "name", "date",
      "comment", "runs the date sometime within a 3 hour period",
      "timing", nlist(
          "minute", "0",
          "hour", "1",
          "smear", "180"),
      "command", "/bin/date")
    );

This will create three files in /etc/cron.d:
  ls.ncm-cron.cron
  hostname.ncm-cron.cron
  date.ncm-cron.cron
